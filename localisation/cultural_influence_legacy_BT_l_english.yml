 moravian_nation_desc:0 "While the Slavs in the east scramble to claim the heritage of Rus', in the west we look to Great Moravia as our forebears. The first and, until now, greatest state of western Slavdom. We must claim its mantle as we enter a new golden age for our nation."
 celtic_nation_title:0 "Unite the Celts"
 celtic_nation_desc:0 "For too long the Celtic peoples have been pushed towards the brink of extinction. We must unite our nation if we are to repel our bellicose neighbours and return the Celts to glory."
 irish_nation_title:0 "Claim High Kingship"
 irish_nation_desc:0 "The High Kingship, our most sacred title, has effectively been defunct since the Saxons and Normans invaded. We have followed in the footsteps of our greatest High King, Brian Boru, by uniting Ireland to expel them and the title is indisputably ours. We must now achieve what even he could not and consolidate our power so that we may never suffer foreign domination again."            #Changed from BtP. Event text now in English instead of Irish, just for consistancy
 IRE_parliament_name:0 "Oireachtas"           #Was 'Ardfheis' in BtP, but I'm (Driaocht) changing it to the more historical (and actually modern as well) word generally accepted to mean 'assembly', and used for modern Ireland's parliament as well as (possibly) for a group of noble advisors to the High King.

 celts_six_nations_desc:0 "Our realm is comprised of six core nations, the Irish, the Scottish, the Bretons, the Welsh, the Cornish and the Manx. By drawing on the unique experiences, traditions and customs of all six peoples, we will ignite a new, Celtic Renaissance."
 celts_monastic_schools:0 "Monastic Permeability"
 celts_monastic_schools_desc:0 "In the past, our monasteries served not only as centers of religion, but also as centers of scholarship. Unique in Christendom, our monasticism was permeable. Children were free to enter the monasteries, receive an education, and leave upon reaching adulthood. We must revive this practice and make our realm a beacon of learning."
 celts_soldiers:0 "Battle-Hardened Soldiers"
 celts_soldiers_desc:0 "Our men are renowned throughout Europe as fierce fighters. Our recent victories in the campaign to free the Celtic peoples have only served to reaffirm the truth of that reputation."
 celts_memory:0 "Memory of the Celts"

 celts_illuminated_manuscripts_desc:0 "Our artistic traditions are unlike that of any other culture. Where the rest of Europe strives for quantity over quality, we strive to produce dazzling works of individual perfection. The illuminated manuscripts produced by our people, such as the Book of Kells, are the greatest attestment to this."
 celts_resettle:0 "Resettle Celtic Lands"
 celts_resettle_desc:0 "The Latin, Germanic and Slavic cultures have spread far and wide throughout Europe. We have secured the freedom of our people for now, but to secure it forever we must reclaim and resettle formerly Celtic lands."

Whether travelling from place to place, being employed by a local king, or perfecting their craft in isolation, our artists are without peer and highly sought after. Throughout the land, lineages are recorded, battles are imortalized, and history is brought to life through word and chord."
 tirnangael_gall_oglaigh:0 "Gall Óglaigh"
 tirnangael_gall_oglaigh_desc:0 "The Vikings had significant influence on all of Western Europe, but perhaps nowhere more so than in Gaelic lands, where they settled in great numbers and founded many of the greatest cities. Though they quickly adopted Gaelic culture, language, and religion, the proud martial tradition of these Gaelicised Norse prompted the native Gaels to begin an enduring tradition of hiring these strangers as mercenaries. Known as gall óglaigh, or foreign warriors, these units would go on to become some of the most sought after mercenaries in Europe."
 tirnangael_explorers_legacy:0 "Legacy of Exploration"
 tirnangael_explorers_legacy_desc:0 "Hundreds of years before the Vikings constructed their first longships, and nearly a thousand years before the great navies of Europe began to sail westward, Gaels were sailing and exploring the North Sea, establishing remote settlements and monastic hermitages. To compete in this new age of exploration, we must restore this proud heritage and set sail for undicovered shores."
 tirnangael_brehon_law:0 "Brehon Law"
 tirnangael_brehon_law_desc:0 "Brehon law is a comprehensive system of secular civil laws administered by professional jurists, called Brehons. Dating back to antiquity in Ireland, the legal system is one of the oldest surviving in Europe, and provides great stability. Though largely supplanted by English and Norman law with the conquest of Ireland, it was revived and experienced a renaissance as English influence over Ireland waned."
 tirnangael_gaelic_renown:0 "Gaelic Renown"
 tirnangael_gaelic_renown_desc:0 "Under the yoke of English rule, the Gaels were relegated to the status of provincial rustics, but once, Gaelic courtiers were renowned throughout Europe as the finest musicians and the most enlightened scholars. From Iberia to Scandinavia, a king was often not considered a true king unless he employed a Gaelic musician and classical scholar. Now free from the bonds of our former English masters, we are free to reclaim this international prestige."
 tirnangael_monastic_heritage:0 "Gaelic Monasticism"
 tirnangael_monastic_heritage_desc:0 "From the earliest exposure to Christianity, the Gaels have enthusiastically and competently spread their faith. From the evangelization of the Picts in Scotland and the Saxons in England, to the rise of Gaelic monasticism in central Europe, the Gaels have maintained a strong ecclesiastical tradition of benign missionaries and adaptable monasticism. While the rest of the British Isles embraced the ideals of the Reformation, the lands of the Gaels remained a bastion of Catholicism and strongly resisted the secularization of church power."
 tirnangael_beacon_of_civ:0 "Beacon of Civilization"
 tirnangael_beacon_of_civ_desc:0 "The Gaels were the first in Europe outside of the Greeks and Romans to adopt the written word for their language, and the only ones to maintain Latin and Greek scholarship when the rest of Europe fell into its dark ages. For centuries the Gaels have been a civilizing and stabilizing force, and now is the time to formalize this by issuing a mandate: Let the Gael be the saviour of idealism in modern intellectual and social life, the regenerator and rejuvenator of the literature of the world, and the instructor of nations!"

 tir_na_ngael_nation_desc:0 "The Gaelic peoples continue to maintain close ties on either side of the Sea of Moyle, but seperated by geography and under the yoke of Germanic powers, the Gaels have slowly drifted apart. Now, however, we are finally poised to reunite all Gaels under the authority of the same High King in a true Tír na nGael, the country of the Gaels!"
 albion_nation_title:0 "Form Ynys y Cedyrn"
 albion_nation_desc:0 "Ever since the Saxons invaded and stole our ancient homeland from us, we have dreamed of recovering all of the Isle of Britain. Our ancient legends tell of Arthur's return to lead us to victory against the Saxons, but we cannot wait on legends to save us, for the glory of all Britons, let us found Ynys y Cedyrn, the Isle of the Mighty, and reclaim the whole of our beautiful island and beyond!"
